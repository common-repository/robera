== Description ==
Think of having a real salesperson in your online store who can read a customer’s mind through his/her interactions and help him/her to get what he/she wants from your Ecommerce. Robera gives you this ability using artificial intelligence methods to learn your customers’ preferences and provide them with recommendations they need. Robera Recommendation is a WooCommerce plugin which gives your Ecommerce (your website) the ability to earn more conversion through the “Things “YOU” might like” block (ribbon) in the homepage, by providing personalized item recommendations and the Related Products Block (ribbon) in every product’s page. This kind of recommendation can lead up to a double time conversion on the related products block and up to 20% more conversion on the homepage block. Download this free version of Robera and enjoy the increase of conversion in your ECommerce!
= WHAT DOES THIS PLUGIN DO? =
Robera Recommendation plugin connects your WooCommerce store to Robera server without any additional sign up and logins. Your website will send all interactions (views, add to carts and complete purchases) of both logged in members and anonymous users to our server and Robera’s intelligent engine will learn the customer’s preferences and provide him/her with a ribbon full of items that are personalized recommendations. 
= User Based Recommendation Block =
By enabling the plugin, a personalized block can be added to the homepage in which the items are recommended based on the customer’s interests. 
Note: don’t forget to add a title for that block in the page editor.
= More Effective Related Products Recommendation =
You can enable the default related product block in each product page will be replaced with a new block in which the shown items are based on previous behaviors of other customers. 
= Simple Dashboard =
In the plugin dashboard (admin panel) you can see the statistics of the related products block and the User Recommendation block in the homepage. Don’t get confused with the numbers and put your cursor on each number and read the tool tips.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Status Bar? =
- “Receiving Data” means your website is sending your previous data. That will take a while intentionally. If we receive all your data at once, your loading speed will fall immediately. So have patience and come back few hours later.
- “Training the Engine” means that Robera have received your data and is learning your users’ behavior. This phase doesn’t take much time; maybe less than 10 minutes.
- “Ready” means “Ready”! Now you can use the plugin’s features.
= How long after setting up the plugin does it take to enable the recommendation block? =
When the status is “Ready”. Before that, you cannot use the Robera Recommendation block in any of the pages because the engine has not been ready for recommending any item. This is also true about the Related Products. This preparation will take few hours.
Once the engine’s status is ready, both Related Products and Robera Recommendation block will be enabled and ready to use.
= Where do I find the User Recommendation block? =
It’s like other WooCommerce blocks. Open a page to edit > add a block > WooCommerce > choose the Robera Recommendation block.
= How much will the recommendations increase my conversion? =
Roughly CTR increases 30% to 100%, but it depends on your business type and size of data, but the more you use the service, the more data Robera will have to learn and reach better recommendations. At the first step we will just receive your sell history because you didn’t save your page views respected to each person, but once you activate the service, page views and products added to carts will be saved on Robera’s server which are valuable information to train the system.
Remember that by “conversion” we mean “clicking”. We will just increase the probability of clicking on items and you are the one who has to care about collecting good products in your shop.
= What is “Related products section class name”? =
The css classes of the html block that shows Related Products in every product page of your website. Robera needs to know this to count the number of users’ clicks on related products. In many themes its css class is “related products”. Be sure to check this. If the class is “related products” you don’t have to bother yourself to set this in plugin settings.
